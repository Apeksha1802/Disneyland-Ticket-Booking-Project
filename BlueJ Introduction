BlueJ is an integrated development environment (IDE) for the Java programming language, developed mainly for educational purposes but also suitable for small-scale software development. It runs with the help of JDK (Java Development Kit).
The development of BlueJ was started in 2000 by Michael Kolling and John Rosenberg at Monash University, as a successor to the Blue system. BlueJ is an Object Oriented Programming (OOPS) Software where the programs are written in the form of modules and are accessed by creating objects.
